Purpose: Fast generation of a RUBiS database

The RUBiS benchmark provides the ability to generate a database using
the benchmark itself. This tool generates a RUBiS compatible database
without the use of the RUBiS benchmark.

Steps: 

-Start postgresql.
	
	The script gopostgresql.bash is an example start script. Note, 
	reporting is piped to /dev/null for speed.

-In create_empty_rubis_db.sh, set RUBIS_DIR to point to where the top 
 directory of the RUBiS install.

	This path is needed in the properties file (that will be generated).

-Type './create_empty_rubis_db.sh <integer>'.

	An integer of 10 generates a 256MB database. Scale the integer as 
	you like.

-Stop postgresql.

Result:
	-A database is created under postgresql.
	-A properties file is under a directory with the name of the integer 
	 used above, e.g., '10'
	
Experiment with generating small databases (integers of 1, 5, etc) to
get estimates of time to generate and size of databases relative to
the input parameter. Inputting '2' generates about 500MB database and
takes about 5 minutes on an older Linux server machine.
